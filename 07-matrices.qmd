A matrix is a rectangular array of elements arranged in rows and columns. We typically denote matrices using a bold-faced, upper-case letter. For example, consider the matrix **B** which has 3 rows and 2 columns:


$$
\mathbf{B} = \begin{bmatrix}
5 & 1 \\
7 & 3 \\
-2 & -1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

In psychometric and statistical applications, the data we work with typically have this type of rectangular arrangement. For example, the data in @tbl-01, which includes measures of 5 variables for 100 students, is arranged into the familiar case-by-variable rectangular 'data matrix'.^[In computation, a *matrix* is a very particular type of data structure in which every column has the same type of data (e.g., every column is numeric, or every column is a character variable). A *data frame* is a more generalized computational structure that accommodates multiple types of columns. In some computational languages this structure is referred to as a data matrix.]

```{r}
#| label: tbl-01
#| tbl-cap: "Example set of education data. The data are rectangular, having rows (cases) and columns (variables)."
#| echo: false

d = data.frame(
  ID = c("1", "2", "3", "$\\vdots$", "100"),
  SAT = c("560", "780", "620", "&#8942;", "600"),
  GPA = c("3.0", "3.9", "2.9", "$\\vdots$", "2.7"),
  IQ = c("112", "143", "124", "$\\vdots$", "129"),
  School = c("Public", "Public", "Private", "$\\vdots$", "Public")
)

knitr::kable(
  d, 
  #col.names = c("ID", "SAT", "GPA", "Self-Esteem", "IQ"),
  align = "c",
  table.attr = "style='width:60%;'",
  escape = FALSE
  )  
```

### Dimensions of a Matrix

We define matrices in terms of their *dimensions* or *order*; the number of rows and columns within the matrix. The dimensions of the matrix **B** is $3\times 2$; it has three rows and two columns. Whereas the dimensions of the data matrix is $100\times 5$. We often denote the matrix's dimension by appending it to the bottom of the matrix's name,

$$
\underset{3\times 2}{\mathbf{B}} = \begin{bmatrix}
5 & 1 \\
7 & 3 \\
-2 & -1
\end{bmatrix}
$$ 

<br />


### Indexing Individual Elements

The elements within the matrix are indexed by their row number and column number. For example, $\mathbf{B}_{1,2} = 1$ since the element in the first row and second column is 1. The subscripts on each element indicate the row and column positions of the element.

Vectors are a special case of a matrix, where a row vector is a $1\times n$ matrix, and a column vector is a $n \times 1$ matrix. Note that although a vector can always be described as a matrix, a matrix cannot always be described as a vector.

In general, we define matrix **A**, which has *n* rows and *k* columns as:

$$
\underset{n\times k}{\mathbf{A}} = \begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} & \ldots & a_{1k} \\ 
a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} & \ldots & a_{2k} \\
a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} & \ldots & a_{3k} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
a_{n1} & a_{n2} & a_{n3} & \ldots & a_{nk}
\end{bmatrix}
$$

where element $a_{ij}$ is in the $i^{\mathrm{th}}$ row and $j^{\mathrm{th}}$ column of **A**.

### Geometry of Matrices

A matrix is an *k*-dimensional representation where *k* is the number of columns in the matrix. For example, consider the matrix **M**:

$$
\mathbf{M} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 3 \\ 2 & -2
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Since **M** has two columns, this matrix represents a 2-dimensional structure (i.e., a plane). Each column in the matrix corresponds to a vector in the coordinate system that helps define that structure. **M** is defined by the space encompassed by the vectors $(1, 2)$ and $(3, -2)$. @fig-07-01 shows matrix **M** plotted in the 2-dimensional coordinate space defined by R1 and R2.

```{r}
#| label: fig-07-01
#| fig-cap: "Matrix **M** (yellow) in the 2-dimensional coordinate system defined by R1 and R2."
#| fig-alt: "Matrix **M** (yellow) in the 2-dimensional coordinate system defined by R1 and R2."
#| fig-width: 6
#| fig-height: 6
#| out-width: '70%'
#| echo: false

Because most matrices have much higher dimensions, we typically do not visualize them geometrically.

### Matrices in R

To enter a matrix in R, we use the `matrix()` function, similar to creating a vector. The only difference is that the `nrow=` or `ncol=` argument will include a value other than 1. The elements of the matrix given in the `data=` argument, by default, will be filled-in by columns. For example to create matrix **B** from the earlier example, we can use the following syntax.

```{r}
# Create B by filling in columns
B = matrix(
  data = c(5, 7, -2, 1, 3, -1),
  nrow = 3,
  ncol = 2
  )

# Display B
B
```


The `byrow=TRUE` argument will fill the elements by rows rather than columns.

```{r}
# Create B by filling in rows
B = matrix(
  data = c(5, 1, 7, 3, -2, -1),
  byrow = TRUE,
  nrow = 3
  )

# Display B
B
```

The `dim()` function can be used to return the dimensions of a matrix.

```{r}
# Get matrix dimensions
dim(B)
```

Lastly, we can index elements of a matrix by specifying the row and column number of the matrix object for the element we want in square brackets. These values are separated by a comma. For example, to index the element in **B** that is in the 2nd row and 1st column, we use the following syntax:

```{r}
# Index the element in the 2nd row, 1st column
B[2, 1]
```

## Matrix Equality

Two matrices are said to be equal if they satisfy two conditions:

1. They have the same dimensions, and 
2. All corresponding elements are equal.

Consider the following matrices:

$$
\mathbf{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
112 & 86 & 0 \\ 134 & 94 & 0
\end{bmatrix} \qquad 
\mathbf{B} = \begin{bmatrix}
112 & 134 \\86 & 94 \\ 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix} \qquad 
\mathbf{C} = \begin{bmatrix}
112 & 86 & 0 \\ 134 & 94 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Within this set of matrices,

- $\mathbf{A} \neq \mathbf{B}$, since they do not have the same dimensions. **A** is a $2\times3$ matrix and **B** is a $3\times2$ matrix.
- Similarly, $\mathbf{A} \neq \mathbf{B}$, they also do not have the same dimensions.
- $\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{C}$ since both matrices have the same dimensions and all corresponding elements are equal.
